TODO NOW ***************************
When doing a turn, the data from the previous turn is accepted. Re-init the gameaction when the turn starts



TODO ***************************
Add the description and dependencies for the techs
Add the prerequisites to all advanced items
If a player leaves the server make it die in multiplayer (complete when the game will be playable)
Add credits (special mention for Ollie)
Add more avatars
Implement view panels (in progress)
Add server logs on the remote network, when writing something on the logs send it also to remote managers
Add global balloon for game
Add "what is going on" for the game (typing text)
When all players leave the game, set it as complete. In case AIs are still alive set a winner

IMPROVEMENTS ***************************
if a game is started the game list is not updated server side, neither the participants defined on the server
Do not have the planet too close, and reduce the rotation


CHECK ***************************


BUGS ***************************
If we create a game, then destroy it, then create a new one, we have problems joining it

When restarting a game we have an error because the balloon was destroyed



If we leave the game, the game list still shows the game as "playing" (it may be normal because the game can still have humans inside) >> Add game status "Abandoned"
If going for an improvement we need to select a city! In case the city (owned) is not selected close the view and show a message. If the city was already selected then we show a message to complete the status


PROBABLY WILL NOT FIX ***************************
If we start creating a game, we cannot cancel the operation
