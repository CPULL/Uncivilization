TODO NOW ***************************
Test the basic multiplayer progress
Add code to show what a player did
Add code to research techs and to build improvements
Add the description and dependencies for the techs
Add the prerequisites to all advanced items


TODO ***************************
If a player leaves the server make it die in multiplayer (complete when the game will be playable)
Add credits (special mention for Ollie)
Add more avatars
Implement view panels (in progress)
Add server logs on the remote network, when writing something on the logs send it also to remote managers
Add global balloon for game
Add "what is going on" for the game (typing text)
Add a sprite resource inside the Enemy class and set it to the avatar of human players or basic sprite[0] of AIs


IMPROVEMENTS ***************************
if a game is started the game list is not updated server side, neither the participants defined on the server
Do not have the planet too close, and reduce the rotation


CHECK ***************************


BUGS ***************************
The actions received look empty

If we leave the game, the game list still shows the game as "playing" (it may be normal because the game can still have humans inside) >> Add game status "Abandoned"
If going for an improvement we need to select a city! In case the city (owned) is not selected close the view and show a message. If the city was already selected then we show a message to complete the status


PROBABLY WILL NOT FIX ***************************
If we start creating a game, we cannot cancel the operation
